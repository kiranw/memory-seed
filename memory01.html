<h2>Remembering Isao Takahata</h2>
<h3>January 5, 1941 - April 6, 2018</h3>

<br>
<p>Isao Takahata, a film director who founded Japan’s premier animation studio, Studio Ghibli, with Hayao Miyazaki in 1985 and made sophisticated animated films like the elegiac World War II drama “Grave of the Fireflies,” died early Thursday in Tokyo. He was 82.
</p>

<p>The cause was lung cancer, Studio Ghibli said in a statement.</p>

<p>Studio Ghibli has released some of the highest-grossing anime films ever, like “Ponyo,” “Howl’s Moving Castle,” “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away,” which won an Academy Award for best animated feature in 2003 after an English version was released.</p>

<p>These lushly animated fairy tales were all written and directed by Mr. Miyazaki, whose name is more recognizable to international animation aficionados than that of Mr. Takahata.</p>

<p>Many of Mr. Takahata’s movies were popular, particularly in Japan, and many critics praised his work, especially “Grave of the Fireflies” (1988), a harrowing tale of a brother and sister trying to survive after Japan is devastated by American firebombing during World War II.</p>
